# cuda-programming

## Overview

This repository contains various algorithms implemented using CUDA for parallel processing. My goal is to explore and experiment with parallelization techniques in CUDA across different types of algorithms. Each algorithm will be added as an independent module, and the repository will be updated with new implementations over time.
